# SoundMaker - A digital synth from scratch in C

This project was inspired by the video ["c is better than fl studio"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqJPBu7GXvw) by Magicalbat on Youtube. After seeing this video I wanted to experiment with what he had made and while trying to write some basic melodies I realised there was a lot of potential to expand the project.


### Aims
- Be able to generate .wav header files
- Be able to calculate note duration in seconds based on input
- Be able to generate sound from a compiled C file to a .wav file
- Be able to read data from a file and use that data to generate the melody
- Have multiple wave functions for different sounds such as sine, saw, square waves etc.

### Additional Features
- Be able to control note volume
- Be able to emulate certain audio effects such as delay or reverb
- Graphical user interface (most likely using Dear imGUI and SDL)
- Ability to read MIDI files
